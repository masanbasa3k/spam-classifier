# spam-classifier
This repository contains Python code for building a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter library to interact with a spam classifier model. The spam classifier is trained to classify text messages as spam or non-spam (ham). The interface allows users to enter text and receive a prediction on whether the input text is classified as spam or not. The model is built using natural language processing techniques and the scikit-learn library.

The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for utilizing the spam classifier model, making it easy to classify text messages and identify potential spam. The code is written in Python and utilizes the Tkinter library for GUI development.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a starting point for your own text classification projects or to enhance the functionality of the spam classifier interface."
